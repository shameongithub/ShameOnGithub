# Shame On Github

In the name of God

- I am a **human** being just like you!
- I am, like you, a **developer** and creator of cool things!
- I, like you, had **no control** on where in the world that I was born!
- GitHub has been **restricted** my account just because I live in Iran.
- If you think the GitHub's decision is fair, ignore this repository.
- If you think the GitHub's decision **is not fair**, please do all or some of the following:
  - :star: Star this repository.
  - :fork_and_knife: Fork this repository.
  - :orange_book: Ask the GitHub to change its policies.
  - :broken_heart: Do not use GitHub and choose another alternative.
 
 ## GitHub and Trade Controls
 When I open the GitHub page, the following message is shown:

For individual accounts, you may have limited access to free GitHub public repository services for personal communications only. Please read about GitHub and Trade Controls for more information. If you believe your account has been flagged in error, please file an appeal.
